Isabel's Sample Portfolio

## Project Description

This is the beginning of a portfolio, featuring an About Me blurb, sample projects and contact details. Due to the limited access to completed and high quality projects, the links currently link to my GitHub profile only. The application features a fixed header, with nav items linking to each section of the page. Using a flexbox layout, the page is responsive and suited to both mobile and desktop devices.
